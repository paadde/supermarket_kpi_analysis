## Process
For this project, I'll be utilizing Tableau to craft a dynamic dashboard tailored for management use. The dashboard will offer comprehensive insights into various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) crucial for monitoring the business's performance.

1. Implemented a calculated field to determine total sales from the beginning of the selected month up to the latest date.
